## Description

This is my new portfolio where I will showcase my work. It features an About Me section, a section with all my projects with links to their repos and deployments, a contact form (backend coming soon) and a place where I will upload my resume. It uses React to structure the layout as the user clicks the links in the navigation bar.

## Installation

Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install react and the required packages. Then use the command 'npm start' to run the server. The port is 3000 by default.

## Usage

## Challenges

The hardest parts of this assignment were getting a user's thoughts to be deleted when that user is deleted, and getting the friend and reaction counts to work appropriately. I still think there's room for improvement. For example, there's a few useless data fields that could probably be removed without consequence, and the pathing for the routes is a little convoluted with some redundancies, such as needing to specify the ID in both the path and the JSON body. Overall, I am happy with it, but it could definitely use some work to make it really streamlined.
