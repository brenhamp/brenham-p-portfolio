## Description

This is my new portfolio where I will showcase my work. It features an About Me section, a section with all my projects with links to their repos and deployments, a contact form

## Installation

Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install Express and mongoose. Then use the command 'npm start' to run the server. You will need a client like Insomnia to send requests.

## Usage

Send requests through your client. These are all the routes used:

&nbsp;

- Users: GET all, POST (api/users)

  - GET by ID, PUT, DELETE (api/users/:id)

&nbsp;

- Thoughts: GET all, POST (api/thoughts)

  - GET by ID, PUT, DELETE (api/thoughts/:id)

&nbsp;

- Friends: POST, DELETE (api/users/:id/friends)

&nbsp;

- Reactions: POST, DELETE (api/thoughts/:id/reactions)

&nbsp;

## Demonstration

The following videos will demonstrate all the different functions of this API.

## Challenges

The hardest parts of this assignment were getting a user's thoughts to be deleted when that user is deleted, and getting the friend and reaction counts to work appropriately. I still think there's room for improvement. For example, there's a few useless data fields that could probably be removed without consequence, and the pathing for the routes is a little convoluted with some redundancies, such as needing to specify the ID in both the path and the JSON body. Overall, I am happy with it, but it could definitely use some work to make it really streamlined.
