## Description

This is my new portfolio where I will showcase my work. It features an About Me section, a section with all my projects with links to their repos and deployments, a contact form (backend coming soon) and a place where I will upload my resume. It uses React to structure the layout as the user clicks the links in the navigation bar.

## Installation

Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install react and the required packages. Then use the command 'npm start' to run the server. The port is 3000 by default.

## Challenges

I am still not very good at styling with CSS. Things don't lay out on the page in the way I want to, and I have to rely on templates to fix it. I'm getting a little more comfortable with React, though. It's very different, but in some ways it makes things easier. 

## Contact

I can be reached here on GitHub at [brenhamp](https://github.com/brenhamp) if you have any questions or comments.
